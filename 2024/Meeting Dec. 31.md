1. **novelty**

   > \#reviewer 2:
   >
   > Specifically, both the denoising diffusion model and the Neyman-Pearson lemma for certified robustness are standard techniques. It's unclear what are the new contributions and novelty when applying these techniques in node classification in graph learning.

   > \# reviewer 3:
   >
   > The contribution of this paper is limited, for which it employs the same method in [8] called ‘Structured denoising diffusion models in discrete state-spaces’.

2. **theoretical depth**

   > \#reviewer 2:
   >
   > Neyman-Pearson lemma
   >
   > It's unclear what are the unique theoretical challenges in analyzing robustness of their proposed method.

3. **application**

   > \#reviewer 5:
   >
   > Talk more about the applications of the proposed approach and relevance to IEEE Infocom

4. **邮箱**
